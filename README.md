# Human Activity Recognition with Sensor Data

This project aims to classify human activities based on sensor data collected from smartphones. The dataset used in this project is the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) database, which was built from recordings of 30 study participants performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following information for each record:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial angular velocity from the gyroscope.
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
- Activity label (one of six activities: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying).
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run the code:

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed.
3. Prepare the dataset and ensure it is in the correct format.
4. Run the Python script to preprocess the data, train the machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.
